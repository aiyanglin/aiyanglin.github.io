Welcome to my site! I am a PhD candidate in the Biochemistry, Microbiology and
Immunology department at the University of Saskatchewan. My research is focused
on the mechanisms of *DDI2/3* induction in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. I am
advised by [Dr. Wei Xiao](https://medicine.usask.ca/profiles/biochemistry-microbiology-immunology/wei-xiao.php).

On this website, you can find [raw data](/data/) for my experimental work.
